## Form Controls

This library (`@bahmni/form2-controls`) provides a range of form controls that can be used to create customized forms within the Bahmni platform.

> **Note:** This is version 2 of the form controls library, starting at version `0.0.1`. For the previous version that supports React 16, see the [Legacy Version](#legacy-version-react-16-support) section below.

### Requirements

- React 19.0.0 or higher
- React DOM 19.0.0 or higher

### File naming conventions

1. All components should be in Pascal Case (camel case starting with uppercase letter)
2. Other files including styles should be in Camel Case starting with lowercase letter
3. Test files should have the same name as the file followed by .spec.js

### Setup Steps

1. Install nvm
2. Install node
3. Install yarn - https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install

### Build

1. Install dependencies - `yarn`
2. Build - `yarn build`
3. Test - `yarn test`

### SNOMED Integration Support

form-controls also integrates with SNOMED for terminology lookup as part of form configuration and generation. More details can be found in [this](https://bahmni.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BAH/pages/3132686337/SNOMED+FHIR+Terminology+Server+Integration+with+Bahmni) Wiki link

### TypeScript Support

This library now includes comprehensive TypeScript type definitions for TypeScript consumers.

**Features:**

TypeScript definitions in [`index.d.ts`](./index.d.ts) inlcudes type definations for all exported components (Container, TextBox, NumericBox, AutoComplete, etc.), Type definitions for designer components, Type definitions for helpers, mappers, and services

**Note for Contributors:**
> ⚠️ If you add any new control, make sure to add the type definition for it in [`index.d.ts`](./index.d.ts) to avoid errors/warnings for TypeScript consumers.

The current manual `.d.ts` file provides immediate TypeScript support without requiring any code changes!
